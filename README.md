HTML
CSS, making use of flex
Managing events (such as: clicks, inputs, etc)
Accessing and sending data to a server
Storage of localdata using LocalStorage

## How to install and start the project:

In order to be able to start the project in a local server it is important to first create your own repository and then install npm.
We can do this by running the command 'npm install'. This may take a few minutes and after npm is installed, we can start our project on a local server with the command 'npm start'.
